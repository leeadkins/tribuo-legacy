Welcome to Tribuo!

Tribuo was built for the Marion County Christmas Fund for the Needy. It makes managing hundreds of families and children easier.  You can generate the tags needed for food or toy boxes or get an idea of the amount of toys or food you're going to need.

To get started:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run bundle install
3. If you'd like, change the database settings in config/database.yml
4. Run rake db:schema:load
5. Run the tribuo:user generator (rails g tribuo:user EMAIL PASSWORD) to create your first user.

You can now run "rail server" and use the app. It is also ready to be deployed (Heroku is fun), assuming you change a couple of other settings first:

1. Rerun the devise:install generator. This will recreate a unique pepper for your app for security reasons.
2. After that, change the default email address for the app in config/initializers/devise.rb
3. You will be told (in the console) by Devise (what we use for authentication) to make sure to set the default host in your environments files. These are the config/environments/development.rb and production.rb. The one in your development.rb should look something like this:
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

and the one in production should look something like this:

config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'yourhost.com' }

Make sure to change them, because this is what is used for any emails sent from your app (like when you send an invitation for another user to use the app). If you don't change it, you'll direct them to an installation that isn't yours.

4. Finally, you'll need to make sure your mailer is setup somewhere.  If you are using SMTP, make sure that is setup in the same places as you set the default host before. Many environments you deploy to might not have Sendmail installed, so make sure you get it set correctly one way or the other.  Again, this is important for Devise to send invitation emails.  However, if you aren't going to send invitations, don't worry about it.

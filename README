Welcome to Tribuo!.

This is a very rough start for the project, and you'll see more as we go along.
Many of the initial commits you see will be from me setting up this stranage workflow I'm using for Tribuo.
These include Lighthouse, Github, and Heroku.
For now, there are few things you'll need to do to get going.

You'll need to create a database.yml file that works for you.

You'll also need to create a new migration, with contents similar to this:
class AddFirstRoleAndUser < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    #you'll want to fix this to your liking
    user = User.new
    user.login = "admin"
    user.email = "me@here.com"
    user.password = "admin"
    user.password_confirmation = "admin"
    user.name = "Lee Adkins"
    user.save(false)
    role = Role.new
    role.name = "admin"
    role.editown = 1
    role.editall = 1
    role.admin = 1
    role.save
    newAdmin = User.find_by_login("admin")
    newRole = Role.find_by_name("admin")
    newRole.users << newAdmin
    newAdmin.save
    newRole.save
  end

  def self.down
  end

Modify all those items regarding the User and what you want things to be called so
the initial roles and an initial user can be setup.

That's all for now! I'll be updating very frequently as the project progresses. I'll also 
provide a better idea about what this does too.
